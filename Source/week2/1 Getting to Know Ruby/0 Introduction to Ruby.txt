[MUSIC] Hi, welcome to module two. In module one we talked about
Setting up the Environment to be able to program in Ruby and
Ruby in Rails. Module two it's all Ruby, we'll talk
about things like the Syntax of Ruby. We'll start from the beginning things like
comments, how do you assign variables, how do you define a function. Next we're gonna move on to Collections. By collections I mean things like Arrays,
or Lists and Hashes. Well what's maybe known in other
languages as Dictionaries or Maps. Then we're gonna move onto the Object
Oriented side of Ruby, the Classes, the Inheritance, Modules, Mixins. A lot of people think of Ruby
as a scripting language, and that's not true at all. Ruby actually is a very much
object oriented language. After that,
we're gonna move onto Unit Testing. And Unit Testing is an important
part of any language. Ruby is no exception. We'll talk about how unit
testing is done in Ruby. [MUSIC] Even our point of this module is
to get up to speed with Ruby so you could get to the Ruby on
Rails part of the course. Don't think of it in those terms. Ruby by itself is a very
fascinating language. I myself am coming from a Java background,
I was amazed how by so many tasks that are so verbose in Java that you could
do so easily, or much easier, in Ruby. [MUSIC] Also, I want to mention that,
Module two has a lot of coding examples. I believe that the best way to learn
how to code is to actually code. So please go ahead and copy
the examples from the github repository that will be provided and
follow along the examples. Experiment in the editor by typing, by modifying the examples and executing
the examples and seeing what happens. That's the only way to learn how to code. With that, I will see you in Module two.
